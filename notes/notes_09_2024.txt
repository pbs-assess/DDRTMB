#Notes to discuss on 04/09/2024

- Running devs/run-model-v1.R -- we do not need to source any of the files in the R folder, as they will all 

- On R/project_model the library calls should be removed

- for mcmc, there are a lot of divergent transitions, but I think it may get better with more chains. 
Dan, who uses stan a lot recommends always using 6+ chains.
