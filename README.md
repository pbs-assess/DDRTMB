# DDRTMB
A delay-difference model written in RTMB.

Still under development. Will eventually be made modular and converted to a package.

Currently uses data, inputs and assumptions from the Canadian 2020 Pacific Cod assessment.

To run, run the code in devs/run-model-v1.R

Authors: Robyn Forrest, and Catarina Wor (Pacific Biological Station, Nanaimo, Canada). Based on iscam delay-difference model developed variously by Steve Martell, Robyn Forrest and Catarina Wor.
